# Community Matrices

Functions for dealing with community matrices.

!!! note "Community matrix types"
    This package currently uses a `Matrix{Num}` as a community matrix. In the near future
    this will be changed to use a custom `CommunityMatrix` type which will include useful
    metadata besides what a standard matrix does.
