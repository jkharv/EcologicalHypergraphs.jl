# EcologicalHypergraphs

`EcologicalHypergraphs.jl` allows you to do ecology using hypergraphs. Currently, it 
supports using hypergraphs do create large dynamical foodweb models which can incorporate
non-trophic effects. In the future, it will support statistical study of these hypergraphs
as well. It may also support embedding these hypergraphs in spatial networks in the
future to facilitate metacommunity models.
